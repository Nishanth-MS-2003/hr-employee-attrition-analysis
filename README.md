##  Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)

Performed in Google Colab:

* Checked and handled missing values
* Corrected data types for numerical and categorical columns
* Removed duplicates and irrelevant records
* Validated attrition labels for consistency

Clean data ensured accurate and reliable analysis.

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key EDA findings:

* Overall attrition rate is **16.1%**
* Employees with **low job satisfaction** show significantly higher attrition
* **First 3 years of tenure** are the most critical for employee retention
* Lower income bands are more prone to attrition

EDA helped define KPIs and dashboard metrics.

---

##  SQL Analysis (MySQL)

After cleaning, the data was loaded into MySQL for structured analysis.

### Sample Analysis Performed:

* Attrition rate calculation
* Attrition count by department and job role
* Average monthly income by attrition status
* Attrition trends by tenure buckets

SQL enabled efficient aggregation and business-level querying.

##  Key Insights

* Sales and R&D departments have the highest attrition
* Early-tenure employees are at maximum risk
